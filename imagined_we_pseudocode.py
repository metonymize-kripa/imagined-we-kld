"""
Imagined We Pseudocode
1. Each agent has a single set of belief, goal, and intention variables.However,
it does have vectors for observations and actions for all of the agents in the environment
2. By running inverse reasoning it updates its belief, goal and intention variables (learns) based on
individual agent's observations and actions that it has access to -- a random preferential sampling process 
3. A random mask allows an agent to observe the observation and actions of only a partial fraction w=0.2
of all of the agents. At each iteration the samples visible change
4. Each agent learns and acts to minimize prediction error -- it does this only by acting on the environment, 
and observing the observations and actions of other agents,there is no direct action exchanged between agents
5. By doing so each agent holds an imperfect model of the environment defined in terms of a 
precise account of action and observation vector at each agent boundary
6. The bootstrapped imagined we model in this case is a running estimate of the "mind of the environment"
the model of the environment that each agent holds in its mind
